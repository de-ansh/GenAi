      "Sure! Let's break it down simply:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **var**:  \n",
      "   - **Old School**: `var` is the way to declare variables before ES6 (2015) came around. It’s been around since the early days of JavaScript.\n",
      "   - **Function Scope**: If you declare a variable using `var` inside a function, it’s only accessible within that function. But if you declare it outside any function, it becomes globally accessible throughout your code.\n",
      "   - **Hoisting**: Variables declared with `var` get hoisted to the top of their scope. This means you can use the variable even before you have declared it, though it will be `undefined` if you haven't assigned it a value yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **let**:  \n",
      "   - **Block Scope**: `let` variables are only accessible within the block they are defined in (that’s anything between two curly braces `{}` like in an if statement or a for loop). This means they’re more predictable and safer compared to `var`.\n",
      "   - **No Hoisting Surprise**: While `let` also gets hoisted, you can’t access it before the line where it’s declared in your code. This avoids the weirdness you might get with `var`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **const**:  \n",
      "   - **Block Scope (Like let)**: Just like `let`, `const` also has block scope.\n",
      "   - **Constant, but Not Really**: `const` stands for constant, so once you assign a value to a `const` variable, you can’t change it. But if the variable holds an object or an array, you can still change the properties of that object or the contents of that array. You just can’t point the `const` variable to a new thing.\n",
      "   - **No Reassignment**: If you try to reassign a `const` variable, you’ll get an error.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a quick example of all three in action:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "function example() {\n",
      "    var x = 10;\n",
      "    let y = 20;\n",
      "    const z = 30;\n",
      "\n",
      "    if (true) {\n",
      "        var x = 40;   // This changes the x outside the block too\n",
      "        let y = 50;   // This y is a different variable inside this block\n",
      "        // z = 60;     // This would cause an error because z is a const\n",
      "    }\n",
      "\n",
      "    console.log(x); // 40 - var x was changed\n",
      "    console.log(y); // 20 - let y from outside the block is still 20\n",
      "    console.log(z); // 30 - const z is unchanged\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "example();\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, it's good practice to use `let` and `const` over `var` because they prevent many of the scope-related bugs that can come up with `var`. Use `const` whenever you can, and use `let` when you know you need to reassign a variable.\n"

      "Both `map()` and `filter()` are built-in functions in Python that allow you to process and iterate over items in a sequence, like a list. They are both really useful, but they serve different purposes:\n",
      "\n",
      "### `map()`\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Purpose**: The purpose of `map()` is to apply a function to each item in a sequence and return a new sequence with the results.\n",
      "- **How it works**: You provide `map()` with two arguments: a function and an iterable (like a list). It then applies the function to every item in the iterable.\n",
      "- **Example**: Say you have a list of numbers, and you want to double each number. You could use `map()` with a function that multiplies each number by 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "  ```python\n",
      "  def double(x):\n",
      "      return x * 2\n",
      "\n",
      "  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
      "  doubled = map(double, numbers)\n",
      "  print(list(doubled))  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### `filter()`\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Purpose**: The purpose of `filter()` is to filter out elements from a sequence based on a condition.\n",
      "- **How it works**: You provide `filter()` with a function that returns either `True` or `False` (a predicate function) and an iterable. `filter()` will include an item in the result list only if the function returns `True` for that item.\n",
      "- **Example**: Imagine you have a list of numbers and you want to keep only the even numbers. You could use `filter()` with a function that checks for even numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "  ```python\n",
      "  def is_even(x):\n",
      "      return x % 2 == 0\n",
      "\n",
      "  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
      "  evens = filter(is_even, numbers)\n",
      "  print(list(evens))  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Differences\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Functionality**: `map()` transforms each element, while `filter()` selects certain elements based on a condition.\n",
      "- **Return Type**: In Python 3, both return an iterable of type `map` or `filter` object, which you often convert to a list or another type to see the results.\n",
      "- **Use Case**: Use `map()` when you want to change or process each item in a sequence. Use `filter()` when you want to pick out certain items that meet a condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the gist of it! Both are super powerful and can make your code cleaner and more concise when used appropriately.\n"
